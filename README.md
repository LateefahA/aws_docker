# Lab Overview and Objectives

In this lab, you will undertake the task of migrating a web application to a containerized environment using Docker. Initially, the application is deployed directly on the operating systems of two Amazon EC2 instances. The goal is to transition this setup to utilize Docker containers, enhancing deployment efficiency and scalability.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will have gained the knowledge and hands-on experience to:

- **Create a Dockerfile:** Craft a Dockerfile that specifies the build instructions for creating your application's Docker image.

- **Build a Docker Image:** Utilize the Dockerfile to build a Docker image, encapsulating your application and its environment.

- **Run Containers:** Launch instances of your application by running containers from your Docker image.

- **Container Interaction and Administration:** Learn how to interact with running containers and perform administrative tasks to manage them.

- **Set Up Amazon ECR Repository:** Establish a repository in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) to store your Docker images.

- **Authenticate Docker with Amazon ECR:** Configure the Docker client to authenticate with your Amazon ECR repository.

- **Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR:** Upload your Docker image to the Amazon ECR repository, making it available for deployment.

This lab is designed to provide you with practical experience in containerization concepts and techniques, leveraging Docker and AWS services to streamline application deployment and management.
